In this repository, we release code for PatchDCT in Detectron2. PatchDCT is the fist compressed vector based multi-stage refinement framework.
By using a classifier to refine foreground and background patches, and predicting an informative low-dimensional DCT vector for each mixed patch, PatchDCT generates high-resolution masks with
fine boundaries and low computational cost.



## Installation
#### Requirements
- PyTorch ≥ 1.5 
- einops ≥ 0.6.0

This implementation is based on [detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2). Please refer to [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md). for installation and dataset preparation.

### Train with multiple GPUs
    cd ./projects/PatchDCT/
    ./train.sh

### Testing
    cd ./projects/PatchDCT/
    ./test.sh

#### Notes
- We observe about 0.2 AP noise in COCO.
- The inference time is measured on NVIDIA A100.
- [Lvis 0.5](https://) is used for evaluation.
