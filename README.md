In this repository, we release code for PatchDCT in Detectron2. 

## Contributions
- PatchDCT is the fist compressed vector based multi-stage refinement framework.
- By using a classifier to refine foreground and background patches, and predicting an informative low-dimensional DCT vector for each mixed patch, PatchDCT generates high-resolution masks with
fine boundaries and low computational cost.


## Installation
#### Requirements
- PyTorch â‰¥ 1.8

This implementation is based on [detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2). Please refer to [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md). for installation and dataset preparation.

## Usage 
The codes of this project is on projects/PatchDCT/ 
### Train with multiple GPUs
    cd ./projects/PatchDCT/
    ./train.sh

### Testing
    cd ./projects/PatchDCT/
    ./test.sh
### Speed Testing
    cd ./projects/PatchDCT/
    ./test_speed.sh
### Upper Bound of Model Performance(Table 1 in the paper)
    cd ./projects/PatchDCT/
    ./test_up.sh
    
For Swin-B backbone, use train_net_swinb.py instead of train_net.py

#### Notes
- We observe about 0.2 AP noise in COCO.
- The inference time is measured on NVIDIA A100 with batchsize=1.
- [Lvis 0.5](https://) is used for evaluation.
